# Traffic intensity Detection

***Overview***

Developed an advanced system for vehicle detection and traffic density analysis using deep learning techniques. The system leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic intensity measurements and anomaly detection.

***Key Features***

Vehicle Detection: Utilizes YOLO for accurate vehicle identification in images and video streams.

Traffic Intensity Measurement: Quantifies traffic density and intensity by counting vehicles.

Lane-Specific Analysis: Detects and analyzes vehicles in specific lanes.

Anomaly Detection: Predicts and identifies deviations from typical traffic patterns to forecast anomalies.

Predictive Analytics: Enhances traffic management with early intervention based on traffic metrics.

***Technologies Used***

YOLO Model: For object detection and vehicle identification.

Deep Learning Framework: For model training and evaluation.

Dataset: Diverse vehicle images with rigorous preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization.

***Results***

The system demonstrates high precision and recall in vehicle detection, effectively measures traffic intensity, and forecasts potential traffic anomalies. Provides valuable insights for proactive traffic management and urban planning.
